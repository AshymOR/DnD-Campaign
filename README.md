# DnD-Campaign Concept

* Our team, The Silver Snakes, chose to create a RPG in the vein of Dungeons and Dragons entitled "D&D Campaign."  The game begins with a landing page where players are able to create a new game or resume an existing game. When creating a game, players are taken to a character selection page that enables them to choose the gender, race, class, and temperament along with a unique four-digit ID to be used should they choose not complete the game at this time and would like to save for later play. Based on player's character selections, character stats are listed as well as the image of the character they have chosen.  After character selection is complete, players have the option to continue with their campaign or save and quit.  Should the player continue, they progress to the game itself called the "Battle/Encounter Area."  Here players are faced with a number of decisions that will shape their overall success in the game.  At the end of each campaign players are taken to a results page where they shown the outcome of their decisions and battles.
